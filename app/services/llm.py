Please help me understand this receipt:

{raw_text}

Instructions:
1. Find these key details:
   - Store name (clean it up, remove any extra text)
   - Date of purchase
   - Total amount paid
2. Based on the items listed, determine the overall category from these options: {', '.join(SECTORS)}
   - Choose the category that best represents the majority of items
   - If items are mixed, choose the most significant category

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON, no other text. The JSON must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "vendor": "clean store name",
  "date": "purchase date",
  "total": "total amount",
  "sector": "overall category"
}}

Example:
Input:
LuLu glg
04.02.2025
Total: 3.370
5322 Grnola Rasp ChsCke 35g 0.790
1 X 0.390 S8

Output:
{{
  "vendor": "LuLu",
  "date": "04.02.2025",
  "total": "3.37",
  "sector": "Groceries & Household Supplies"
}}
